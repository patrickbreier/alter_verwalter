"# alter_verwalter" 

To create an environment that can use this code, I highly recomment using a package manager like miniconda (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
With miniconda you can use the environment.yml file to create the environment.
Once the envirnment is installed you should be able to run the jupyter-notebook without errors. Make sure the database and templates are in the same folder as the notebook!
